# Creating Your First Web3 Website

Now that you have a wallet, let's build a website that can interact with it. We will use **Next.js**, a popular React framework, and standard Web3 libraries.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later)
- A code editor (like VS Code)
- Your MetaMask wallet installed

## 1. Initialize a Next.js Project

Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-web3-app
```

You will be asked a few questions. You can use these defaults:
- TypeScript: **Yes**
- ESLint: **Yes**
- Tailwind CSS: **Yes** (Recommended for styling)
- `src/` directory: **Yes**
- App Router: **Yes** (or No if you prefer Pages router, but App Router is modern)

## 2. Navigate to Your Project

```bash
cd my-web3-app
```

## 3. Install Web3 Dependencies

We need libraries to talk to the blockchain. **Wagmi** and **Viem** are excellent modern choices, often used with **RainbowKit** for the wallet connection UI.

```bash
npm install wagmi viem @tanstack/react-query
# Optional: Install RainbowKit for easy wallet connection UI
npm install @rainbow-me/rainbowkit
```

## 4. Run the Development Server

Start your local server to see your new website:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You should see the default Next.js starter page.

## Next Steps

Now you are ready to start building!
- **Connect Wallet**: Implement a "Connect Wallet" button.
- **Read State**: Fetch data from the blockchain (e.g., current block number or token balance).
- **Write State**: Send transactions (e.g., send ETH).
