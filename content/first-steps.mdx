# First Steps: Creating Your First Wallet

To start your journey in Web3, the first thing you need is a wallet. Your wallet acts as your identity and your bank account on the blockchain.

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet stores your **private keys**, keeping your crypto accessible and safe. It allows you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and interact with decentralized applications (dApps).

## 1. Install MetaMask

MetaMask is one of the most popular wallets for the Ethereum ecosystem.

1. Go to the [official MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/).
2. Click "Download" and install the extension for your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge).
3. Once installed, click on the MetaMask fox icon in your browser toolbar.

## 2. Create a New Wallet

1. Click **"Create a new wallet"**.
2. Create a strong password. This password unlocks your wallet on *this specific device*.

## 3. Secure Your Secret Recovery Phrase (CRITICAL) 🔐

This is the most important step.

- MetaMask will show you a **12-word Secret Recovery Phrase**.
- **Write this down on paper** and store it somewhere safe.
- **NEVER** share this phrase with anyone. Anyone with this phrase has full access to your funds.
- **NEVER** store it digitally (like in a text file or screenshot) if you can avoid it.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** If you lose your Secret Recovery Phrase, you lose access to your wallet forever. There is no "forgot password" button in Web3.

## 4. You are Ready!

Congratulations! You now have an Ethereum wallet address (it starts with `0x...`). You can now:
- Receive funds.
- Connect to Web3 websites.
- Deploy smart contracts.
