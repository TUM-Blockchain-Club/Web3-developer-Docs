# Creating Your First Wallet

Welcome to the exciting world of Web3! Before you can dive into building decentralized applications (dApps), you need a way to interact with the blockchain. That's where a crypto wallet comes in.

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet is a digital wallet that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. More importantly for a developer, it's your gateway to interacting with smart contracts and dApps. Think of it as your digital identity on the blockchain.

There are many types of wallets, but for development, we'll focus on browser-based wallets like MetaMask, which are easy to set up and use. For more in-depth information, you can always refer to the [official MetaMask documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/).
