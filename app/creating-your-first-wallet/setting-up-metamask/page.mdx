# Setting Up MetaMask

MetaMask is a browser extension that serves as a bridge between your browser and the Ethereum blockchain. It's an essential tool for any Web3 developer.

## Step 1: Installation

1.  **Open your browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Brave, or Edge).
2.  **Navigate to the MetaMask website**: [metamask.io](https://metamask.io)
3.  **Click the "Download" button** and select your browser to be redirected to the official extension store.
4.  **Add the extension** to your browser.

## Step 2: Wallet Creation

Once installed, the MetaMask icon (a fox head) will appear in your browser's toolbar. Click on it to begin the setup process.

1.  **Click "Get Started"** and then "Create a Wallet."
2.  **Agree to the terms** and create a strong password. This password protects your wallet on your local device.

## Step 3: Secure Your Wallet

This is the most critical step. MetaMask will generate a **12-word seed phrase**, also known as a recovery phrase.

-   **Write this phrase down** on a piece of paper.
-   **Store it in a secure location**, like a safe or a password manager.
-   **Never share it with anyone.** Anyone with this phrase can access your funds.
-   **Never store it digitally** in an unencrypted format (e.g., a plain text file or in your email).

You will be asked to confirm your seed phrase to ensure you've saved it correctly.

## Step 4: You're All Set!

Congratulations! You now have a crypto wallet. You can access it by clicking the MetaMask icon in your browser. In the next sections, we'll cover how to get test funds and how to manage your private keys.
