# Creating Your First Web3 Website

Now that you have a wallet and understand the basics of interacting with the blockchain, it's time to build your first decentralized application (dApp). In this section, we'll guide you through the process of creating a simple web3 website using Next.js.

## What is a dApp?

A dApp, or decentralized application, is an application that runs on a decentralized network, like the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional web apps, the backend of a dApp is a smart contract, which means it's transparent, immutable, and not controlled by a single entity.

## Our Tech Stack

For this guide, we'll be using a modern and popular tech stack:

-   **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building fast and user-friendly websites.
-   **ethers.js**: A lightweight and comprehensive library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
-   **MetaMask**: As our bridge between the browser and the blockchain.

In the following pages, we'll cover how to set up your Next.js project, connect to the blockchain, and interact with a simple smart contract. Let's get building!
