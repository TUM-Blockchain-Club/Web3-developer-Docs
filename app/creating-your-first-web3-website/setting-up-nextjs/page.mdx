# Setting Up Your Next.js Project

Next.js is a fantastic choice for building a Web3 frontend. Its features like server-side rendering and API routes make it a versatile framework. Let's get a new project up and running.

## Step 1: Create a New Next.js App

If you don't have it already, you'll need Node.js and a package manager like `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn`. We recommend `pnpm`.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pnpm create next-app my-web3-app
```

This will create a new directory called `my-web3-app` with a boilerplate Next.js project.

## Step 2: Install Web3 Dependencies

Next, we need to install the libraries that will allow our app to communicate with the blockchain. For this guide, we'll use `ethers.js`.

Navigate into your new project directory and install `ethers.js`:

```bash
cd my-web3-app
pnpm add ethers
```

## Step 3: Start the Development Server

Now, you can start the Next.js development server to see your app in action:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the default Next.js welcome page.

With your project set up, you're now ready to start writing some Web3 code. In the next section, we'll create a simple component to connect to a user's MetaMask wallet.
