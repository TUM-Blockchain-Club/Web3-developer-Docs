# 🦊 MetaMask & Wallet Fundamentals

*A practical introduction to how wallets, keys, gas, and DeFi actually work.*

---

## 🤔 What Is a Wallet? (It’s not what you think)

### ❌ MetaMask is NOT
- A place where your money is stored
- A bank
- A blockchain

### ✅ MetaMask IS
- 🔐 **Key manager** – securely stores your private keys (encrypted)
- 🌐 **RPC client** – talks to blockchains via `window.ethereum`
- ✍️ **Signer** – cryptographically signs transactions and messages

> **Key takeaway:**  
> The blockchain is the database.  
> MetaMask is just the communicator.  
> If MetaMask disappears, your account still exists.

## 🔑 Public vs. Private Keys

- **Private Key** 🔒  
  - Proves ownership  
  - Never share (outside dev/test scenarios)

- **Public Key** 🔓  
  - Derived from the private key

- **Address** 📬  
  - Hash of the public key  
  - Safe to share  
  - Used to receive funds

⚠️ Blockchain transactions are **final**.  
There is no undo button.

## 🌱 Seed Phrases (BIP-39)

### 🧮 The math
- 12 words = representation of massive entropy
- Based on a fixed list of **2048 words**
- Total combinations: **~5.4 × 10³⁹**

### 🌳 The hierarchy
Seed Phrase → Private Keys → Public Keys → Addresses

### 🚨 The danger
- One seed controls **all derived accounts**
- Leaking the seed = total loss
- Wallet passwords only protect **locally**, not on-chain

> Whoever has the seed **is you**.

---

## ⛽ Gas = Compute Credits

You cannot write to the blockchain for free.

### The formula
Transaction Fee = Gas Used × Gas Price
### Key concepts
- **Gas** → amount of computation
- **Gas limit** → max you’re willing to pay
- **Gas price (Gwei)** → priority in the network
- **Nonce** → your personal transaction counter  
  (prevents replay attacks)

Higher gas price = faster inclusion ⏩

## 🔍 Reading the Blockchain (Etherscan)

- The blockchain is a **public database**
- Anyone can inspect:
  - Transactions
  - Balances
  - Contract interactions
- Tools like **Etherscan** are just explorers — not special permissions

> Sending crypto = writing to the database  
> Reading Etherscan = reading the database

---

## 🔁 What Is Uniswap?

### 🧠 As a protocol
- Smart contracts deployed on Ethereum
- Runs autonomously (no servers, no company)
- Can be used without a website

### 🖥️ As a dApp
- Website = graphical interface
- Generates complex transactions for you
- Your wallet signs and submits them

> The frontend is optional.  
> The smart contracts are the real product.

---

## ✅ The “Approval” Pattern (Very Important)

### The problem
Smart contracts cannot move your tokens automatically.

### The solution (ERC-20 standard)
1. **Approve**  
   > “I allow Uniswap to spend 100 USDC”
2. **TransferFrom**  
   > “Uniswap takes the USDC and gives ETH”

### ETH vs Tokens
- **ETH** → native currency (no approval needed)
- **ERC-20 tokens** → separate contracts (approval required)

⚠️ Token → ETH swaps always need approval first.

---

## 🏠 To-Do (Recommended Practice)

- Swap ETH → USDC on Uniswap
- Supply USDC as collateral
- Borrow DAI
- Research:
  - Lending protocols (Aave)
  - Health factor
  - Liquidation risk

---

## 🧠 Final Takeaways

- Wallets manage **keys**, not money
- Seed phrases are absolute power
- Gas is payment for computation
- dApps = frontend + smart contracts
- Approvals are fundamental to DeFi
