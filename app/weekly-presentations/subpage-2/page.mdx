# 🚀 Hackathon Preparation Guide

*A practical, no-BS guide to performing well at Web3 hackathons.*

---

## 🤔 What Is a Hackathon (and what it isn’t)

### ❌ It is NOT
- A pure coding contest  
- A 48-hour caffeine marathon  
- About shipping the biggest codebase  

### ✅ It IS
- 🧠 Problem clarity  
- 💡 Originality  
- 🛠️ Technical feasibility  
- 🎤 Pitch quality  

> A hackathon is a **product + storytelling competition under time pressure**.

---

## 🌐 Web3 Hackathons — What’s Different?

- Usually **less competitive** than traditional hackathons
- Focus on **chain-specific strengths**
- Common tracks:
  - 🧰 Developer tooling (SDKs, indexers)
  - 🌍 Public goods
  - 🧪 Frontier experiments (UX, social, creative)
- 💰 Often include **bounties** for using specific protocols or APIs

---

## 🧠 Choosing a Winning Idea

### ❌ Avoid buzzwords
- Metaverse  
- AI everywhere  
- Quantum everything  

### ✅ Focus on real problems
- Payments  
- DeFi UX  
- Developer tooling  
- User onboarding  

### 🔗 Use chain advantages
- Ethereum → EVM ecosystem  
- Solana → Low latency  
- Sui → High throughput  
- New chains → Low competition  

---

## ⚡ Build Faster, Not Harder

### 🤖 Use AI
- **v0.dev** → frontend scaffolds  
- **Cursor** → fast refactors  
- **ChatGPT / Claude** → contracts & backend logic  

### 🧱 Don’t reinvent the wheel
- Use existing SDKs & APIs  
- Prefer scaffolds over blank projects  
- Shipping > perfection  

---

## 🚢 Deployment (Fast & Free)

### 🎨 Frontend
- Zero setup
- Deploy directly from GitHub
- Built-in environment variables
- Free domains
- Perfect for demos

**Great combo:** Frontend + Supabase + Railway

### ⚙️ Backend
- Same zero-setup flow
- Free trials are enough
- No server maintenance

---

## 🗄️ Data: Minimal but Professional

### ❌ CSV / JSON
**Pros**
- Simple
- Zero setup

**Cons**
- No auth
- No concurrency
- Not scalable
- Team-unfriendly

### ✅ Supabase
- Free & hosted
- Auth in minutes
- Realtime support
- SQL power
- Team-ready

---

## 🔐 Secrets Management

### 🔒 Keep secret
- Private keys  
- API keys  
- Premium RPCs  
- Passwords  

### ⚠️ Also don’t hardcode
- Chain IDs  
- Contract addresses  
- RPC URLs  

👉 Always use **environment variables**.

## 🧪 Testnets & Faucets

- Solana → https://faucet.solana.com  
- Ethereum (Sepolia) → https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de  
- Sui → https://faucet.sui.io  
- USDC → https://faucet.circle.com

## 🏁 Final Tips (WAGMI)

- 🚰 Use faucets early  
- ✅ Finish **at least one feature fully**  
- 🎤 Demo prep takes longer than you think  
- 🧑‍⚖️ Know your judges  
- 😴 All-nighters don’t guarantee wins
