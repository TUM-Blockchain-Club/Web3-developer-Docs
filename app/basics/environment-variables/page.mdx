# 🔒 Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to store **configuration and secrets** outside of your source code. They allow you to change behavior between development, testing, and production **without modifying the code itself**.

In Web3 projects, environment variables are **critical for security**.

## Why environment variables matter in Web3

Most blockchain applications rely on sensitive values such as:

- RPC endpoints (Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode, Helius)
- Private keys / signer keys
- API keys (indexers, explorers, price feeds)
- Contract addresses that differ per network

Hard-coding these values into your codebase is **dangerous** and often leads to **fund loss** or **key leaks**.

## Common examples

```env
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/XXXX
PRIVATE_KEY=0xabc123...
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN=solana
