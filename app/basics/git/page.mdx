# 🌿 Git




[Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git) is the standard tool for tracking code changes and collaborating. It is essential for anyone working on smart contracts, blockchain tooling, or decentralized applications. Its structure resembles a lightweight local “ledger” that records every update to your project.

### 🧱 Why does it matter in Web3

- Keeps a transparent history of all code changes
- Branching allows safe experimentation (similar to testnets)
- Pull requests enable review before merging (like proposing protocol upgrades)
- Crucial when multiple contributors work on the same smart-contract or dApp repository

### 🚀 Core Commands
```bash
git clone <repo>      # Download the project
git status            # View changes
git add .             # Stage edits
git commit -m ""      # Create a new commit ('block' in your history)
git pull              # Sync with remote updates
git push              # Publish your changes
```


### 🌿 Typical Web3 Workflow

* **Clone a smart contract template or protocol repository**: [Solana Starter Kit](https://github.com/SolanaUpdateTools/solana-starter-kit), [dapp-scaffold (Solana)](https://github.com/solana-labs/dapp-scaffold), [Scaffold-ETH (Ethereum)](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2), [template-ethereum-contracts](https://github.com/wighawag/template-ethereum-contracts)

* **Create a feature branch to test new logic or contract upgrades**  
  Keeps your experiments isolated from the main codebase; you can safely test without breaking the main protocol.  
  Example commands:
  ```bash
  # Create and switch to a new branch
  git checkout -b feature/my-new-contract

  # Check branch status
  git status

* **Submit a pull request for review**  
  Similar to proposing an on-chain improvement. Your code can be audited and discussed by peers before merging:  
  ```bash
  # Push your feature branch to remote
  git push origin feature/my-new-contract

  # Open a pull request on GitHub/GitLab
  # (usually via the repository web interface)

* **Merge only after audits or peer review**  
  Ensures that all changes are verified, reducing the risk of bugs or vulnerabilities in your deployed contracts.  
  ```bash
  # Switch to main branch
  git checkout main

  # Merge the feature branch after approval
  git merge feature/my-new-contract

  # Push merged changes to remote
  git push origin main



### 🛡 Good Practices
- Write clear commit messages
- Pull regularly to avoid conflicts
- Avoid pushing directly to main
- Review code with the same care as auditing a smart contract
