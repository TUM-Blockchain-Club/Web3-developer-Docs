# 🚀 Getting Started

You already know **Web2**:

- You log in with a username and password  
- A company stores your data  
- If their server is down, the service stops  
- You rely on one platform

Web3 works differently:

- You “log in” using your wallet  
- Your data and assets live on a blockchain  
- Anyone can interact directly with the network  
- You control your account yourself

**In short:**  
Web2 = controlled by companies  
Web3 = controlled by you

To use Web3, you need a wallet.
