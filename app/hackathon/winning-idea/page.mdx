# Winning Idea?

The idea you choose for a hackathon can make all the difference between winning and just participating. 

- **Look for problems, not buzzwords**
  - Buzzwords: <span style={{ color: "red" }}>Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence, Hyperautomation, Quantum Computing.</span>
  - Problems: <span style={{ color: "green" }}>Payments, DeFi, Community, Developer Tooling, User Onboarding.</span>

- **Is the solution significantly better with adding crypto or would it be better without it?**
  - Build something that would make sense because of crypto.

- **Is it a net positive to the ecosystem? Will it bring more users/liquidity?**
  - Don't focus on building something assuming there are tons of users ready to use it, rather build something of use case right here and now.

- **Look for chain-specific ideas**
  - "You get instant points if you've built something that can only be built on that chain, that other chains couldn't handle" – Co-Founder @[Helius](https://www.helius.dev/)
  - Build something that benefits from that chain's unique characteristics, such as transaction speed, composability, and ascending market use cases.

- **Make a functional UI**
  - It does not have to be beautiful, just construct something practical, something that judges can feel, that is better to look at than an API.

- **Spend more than 20% of your time on your presentation**
  - People do not look at your code first.
  - Make your presentation interesting.
  - Try to include a demo video.

Lastly, build something <span style={{ color: "orange" }}>cool</span>.
