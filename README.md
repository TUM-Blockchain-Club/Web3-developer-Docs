Before you write a single line of code, you need to understand how to interact with the blockchain. This section covers the essentials:
- **Setting up a Wallet**: How to install and configure wallets like MetaMask.
- **Security First**: Understanding private keys, seed phrases, and how to keep your assets safe.
- **Getting Funds**: How to use faucets to get testnet tokens for development.

### 📚 Developer Resources

Once you are set up, dive into the tools of the trade:
- **Smart Contracts**: Introduction to Solidity and other contract languages.
- **Development Frameworks**: Hardhat, Foundry, and more.
- **Connecting to the Blockchain**: RPC providers and libraries like ethers.js, viem, or wagmi.

### 🌐 Building Your First Web3 Website

The ultimate goal of this guide is to help you ship. In the final section, we bring it all together:
